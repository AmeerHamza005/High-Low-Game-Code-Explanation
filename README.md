### High-Low Game Code Explanation

This Python code implements a simple "High-Low" guessing game where the player tries to guess if their randomly generated number is higher or lower than the computer's randomly generated number.

---

#### Step 1: Import the `random` Module
```python
import random
```
- We import the `random` module to use `random.randint()`, which allows us to generate random numbers for both the player and the computer.

---

#### Step 2: Define the `play_high_low` Function
```python
def play_high_low():
```
- We define a function named `play_high_low()` that contains the main logic of the game.
- This function will generate random numbers, prompt the player for their guess, and check if the guess is correct.

---

#### Step 3: Generate Random Numbers for the Player and Computer
```python
    player_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    computer_number = random.randint(1, 100)
```
- `player_number`: A random number between 1 and 100 is assigned to the player. The player will see this number.
- `computer_number`: A separate random number between 1 and 100 is assigned to the computer. This number remains hidden from the player.

---

#### Step 4: Display the Player's Number
```python
    print(f"Your number is: {player_number}")
```
- We display the player's number so they know what it is before making a guess.

---

#### Step 5: Prompt the Player for a Guess
```python
    guess = input("Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's number? (Type 'higher' or 'lower'): ").strip().lower()
```
- The player is prompted to guess if their number is "higher" or "lower" than the computer's number.
- The `strip().lower()` methods are used to remove any extra spaces and convert the input to lowercase to handle different input formats.

---

#### Step 6: Allow for Variations in Input
```python
    if guess in ["high", "higher"]:
        guess = "higher"
    elif guess in ["low", "lower"]:
        guess = "lower"
```
- We handle common variations in player input, allowing "high" or "higher" to mean "higher," and "low" or "lower" to mean "lower."
- This makes the game more flexible, as it can handle slight variations in input.

---

#### Step 7: Check if the Player's Guess is Correct
```python
    if (guess == 'higher' and player_number > computer_number) or (guess == 'lower' and player_number < computer_number):
        print("Correct! You guessed right.")
        print(f"The computer's number was: {computer_number}")
        return 1  # Returns 1 point for a correct guess
    else:
        print("Wrong guess.")
        print(f"The computer's number was: {computer_number}")
        return 0  # Returns 0 points for a wrong guess
```
- We use an `if` statement to check if the playerâ€™s guess matches the actual relationship between the two numbers:
  - If the player guessed "higher" and their number is indeed higher than the computer's, they win.
  - Similarly, if the player guessed "lower" and their number is actually lower than the computer's, they also win.
- If the guess is correct, we print a success message and reveal the computer's number, awarding 1 point.
- If the guess is incorrect, we print a message indicating the wrong guess and reveal the computer's number, awarding 0 points.

---

#### Step 8: Define the Main Function
```python
def main():
    print("Welcome to the High-Low Game!")
    points = play_high_low()
    print(f"Your total points: {points}")
```
- The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
- It displays a welcome message, calls the `play_high_low()` function to play the game, and then displays the total points earned by the player.

---

#### Step 9: Run the Game
```python
main()
```
- Finally, we call the `main()` function to start the game when the script is run.

---

### Summary

This High-Low game is a simple yet effective example of using **random number generation**, **input handling**, **if-else conditions**, and **Boolean logic** in Python. By following these steps, the player can enjoy a fun guessing game while learning basic programming concepts.
